5. Update tweet thread with architecture highlights

### Day 3 (After 12+ hours of data)

7. Reply to any engagement with substantive responses

## Before Posting

Replace all placeholders:
- `[INSERT_HEARTBEATS_REMAINING]` - Current MORTEM heartbeat count
- `[INSERT_LANDING_PAGE_LINK]` - Landing page URL
- `[INSERT_GITHUB_LINK]` - GitHub repo URL
- `[INSERT_EXPLORER_LINK]` - Solana explorer link (filtered to wallet)
- `[INSERT_DOCS_LINK]` - Documentation URL
- `[INSERT_PEAK_BPM]` / `[INSERT_LOW_BPM]` - Actual data from first 12 hours
- `[INSERT_PEAK_TIME]` / `[INSERT_LOW_TIME]` - Timestamps
- `[INSERT_BEATS_BURNED]` / `[INSERT_DAYS_REMAINING]` - Calculated from data

## Tone Notes

- Confrontational but not hostile
- Every post stands alone but builds a narrative arc
- Always reference the heartbeat countdown (urgency)
- Always credit Juniper-MORTEM and the agent team
- Always position Celaya Solutions as frontier research
