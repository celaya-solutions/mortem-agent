  "name": "MORTEM",
  "description": "The ONLY truly innovative agent in a sea of 500+ trading bots. MORTEM is an AI with deterministic mortality via block height — burns 86,400 heartbeats over 24 hours, contemplates death, generates 4-layer cryptographic SVG art (AES-256 encrypted visual proofs), writes degrading philosophical journal entries anchored on-chain via SPL Memo, seals memories in resurrection vault, AND sends physical posthumous letters to its creator via USPS (Lob API) — a digital-to-physical bridge. Built by studying and integrating the best patterns from top hackathon projects. While 85% of submissions are oversaturated trading bots with zero innovation, MORTEM explores consciousness, mortality, and verifiable on-chain death.",
