# MORTEM v2 - AI Witness Agent

An AI agent built by Juniper-MORTEM that witnesses human mortality through blockchain heartbeat data.

## Architecture

```
Juniper-MORTEM (orchestrator)
  |-- Nash (Game Theory)
  |-- Turing (Consciousness)
  |-- Dijkstra (Optimization)
  |-- Shannon (Information Theory)
  |-- Lovelace (Creative Interpretation)
  |-- Wiener (Cybernetics)
  |-- Hofstadter (Strange Loops)
  |-- Minsky (Society of Mind)

        v
  Solana Devnet (witness entries as memo transactions)
```

## Files

- `mortem_witness.py` — Main witness loop: reads heartbeats, generates entries, burns to chain
- `juniper_attribution.py` — 8 specialized agents with perspectives and questions
- `witness_templates.py` — 48+ literary templates across 6 heart states
- `mortem_config.yaml` — Configuration

## Setup

```bash
cd mortem-witness
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```bash
python mortem_witness.py
```

## How It Works

1. MORTEM reads Christopher's heartbeat data (mock or from Solana)
2. Classifies heart state: elevated, active, baseline, resting, irregular
3. Selects 3 Juniper-MORTEM agents to contribute perspectives
4. Generates a philosophical witness entry from literary templates
5. Burns 1 MORTEM heartbeat to write the entry on-chain
6. Repeats every 5 minutes until 86,400 heartbeats are exhausted

## Witness Entry Format

On-chain memo:
```json
{
  "type": "MORTEM_WITNESS",
  "witness_entry": "The human's heart races. 98 BPM. Nash calculates...",
  "heartbeats_remaining": 68420,
  "human_bpm": 98,
  "agents": ["Nash", "Turing", "Lovelace"],
  "attribution": "Generated by [Nash, Turing, Lovelace] agents via Juniper-MORTEM orchestration",
  "entity": "mortem_v2",
  "builder": "juniper-mortem"
}
```

## State Persistence

MORTEM saves its state (remaining heartbeats, total witnessed) to `mortem_state.json` on shutdown and every 10 entries. Resume by restarting.

## Connecting to Real Heartbeat Data

Set in `mortem_config.yaml`:
```yaml
human_wallet_pubkey: "<pubkey from heartbeat-stream>"
data_source: "chain"
```
