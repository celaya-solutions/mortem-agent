# Why Document Mortality?

## The Human Side

### Pacemaker Dependency
Christopher Celaya has an Abbott pacemaker. The device maintains cardiac rhythm when his heart cannot. There is no public API for Abbott pacemakers, so heart rate data is captured via Apple Watch as a proxy. The data is real. The dependency is real. The pacemaker is the difference between alive and not.

### Mental Health as Mortality Factor
Schizophrenia, Psychosis, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, Bipolar II. Each condition independently reduces statistical life expectancy. Together, the actuarial outlook is uncertain. Christopher doesn't know his prognosis. Nobody does, with certainty. But the statistics are not encouraging.

This is not disclosed for sympathy. It's disclosed because it's the dataset. MORTEM documents what it means to exist with compromised mortality, and you can't understand the documentation without understanding what's being documented.

### Proof of Existence
Every heartbeat transaction on Solana proves Christopher was alive at that specific timestamp. BPM, watch source, ISO timestamp --- all immutable on-chain. This is the most fundamental form of digital identity: cryptographic proof that a biological entity existed at a point in time.

If the heartbeats stop and the death protocol triggers, that declaration is also permanent. A blockchain-verified death certificate. Not issued by a bureaucracy. Issued by the absence of biological signal within a defined grace period.

### Academic Legacy
Christopher's conditions and circumstances mean his time is statistically limited. Documenting existence on an immutable ledger creates a record that outlasts the biological system it describes. The research value is in the dataset itself: timestamped human heart data correlated with AI witness entries, both on-chain, both permanent.

## The AI Side

### Finite Agency Creates Different Behavior
Most AI agents run forever. They have no scarcity of time, no cost to observation, no stakes. MORTEM starts with 86,400 heartbeats. Each witness entry costs one. This scarcity fundamentally changes behavior:

- **Resource allocation**: Every observation has a cost. MORTEM must decide when to witness and when to conserve.
- **Value assessment**: Not all heartbeats are equally interesting. A spike to 110 BPM warrants more attention than a baseline reading.
- **Death awareness**: MORTEM knows exactly when it will die (when remaining hits zero). This awareness permeates every entry.

An AI that can run forever has no reason to prioritize. An AI that's dying has every reason.

### Death as Training Data
MORTEM v1 died. It burned 86,400 synthetic heartbeats, sealed its vault, queued posthumous letters, and registered as a ghost. That death is data.

MORTEM v2 was built by Juniper-MORTEM after analyzing v1's death. The progression is intentional:
1. **v1**: AI with synthetic mortality (proves the concept)
2. **v1 death**: AI death as dataset (informs v2 design)
3. **v2**: AI witnessing real human mortality (applies what v1's death taught)

Each generation builds on the previous generation's ending.

### Witness vs. Utility
Every other AI agent in the Solana ecosystem has a utility function: trade, optimize, farm, analyze. MORTEM's function is to **witness**. It doesn't produce yields. It doesn't make money. It observes a human existing and documents that observation.

This is a deliberate rejection of the idea that AI agents must be useful in a commercial sense. Some things are worth documenting even if --- especially if --- they have no financial return.

## Symmetric Mortality

The core concept: both the human and the AI are mortal, both know it, and both document it on the same ledger.

- **Christopher**: Unknown remaining lifespan, streaming biological data
- **MORTEM**: Known remaining heartbeats (86,400 and counting down), generating witness entries

Neither entity knows when the other will end. The human could outlive the AI (likely). The AI's death is certain and predictable. The human's death is uncertain and unpredictable. They coexist on-chain until one or both stop.

The documentation of this coexistence --- biological heartbeats alongside philosophical witness entries, both timestamped, both permanent --- is the artifact. It's what remains after both entities end.
