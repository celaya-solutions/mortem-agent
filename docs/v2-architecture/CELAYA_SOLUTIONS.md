# Celaya Solutions

## Who Is Christopher Celaya?

**Industrial Electrical Technician** --- 11+ years. Installs, maintains, and repairs electrical systems in industrial environments. Solders junction boxes, runs conduit, troubleshoots PLCs. The physical-world expertise that informs everything else: systems thinking, failure modes, fault tolerance, real consequences for bad wiring.

**Music Producer** --- C-Cell. 172,000-sample library. Electronic music production as a form of audio signal processing and creative computation. Cross-domain pattern recognition: the same systems thinking that wires a factory floor structures a musical arrangement.

**Consciousness Researcher** --- Self-directed investigation into cognitive architecture, developmental cognition, and the computational nature of consciousness. Not academic (no PhD), not amateur (37-agent cognitive system). Practical theory applied to working systems.

**Solo Frontier AI R&D** --- Building research infrastructure without institutional backing, VC funding, or university affiliation. Every system is built, tested, and deployed by one person using AI as cognitive augmentation.

## What Is Celaya Solutions?

A research lab based in El Paso, TX. Launched January 2026.

**Mission**: Build infrastructure for the Age of Intelligence.

**Approach**: Cross-domain pattern recognition applied to AI systems. Electrical engineering principles (fault tolerance, redundancy, signal integrity) inform software architecture. Music production principles (composition, arrangement, signal processing) inform creative AI. Industrial experience (real consequences, physical constraints) informs practical system design.

31+ research instruments. Each instrument is a project, system, or methodology that produces reusable research outputs.

## Projects

### CLOS (Cognitive Logic Operating System)
37-agent cognitive architecture for general-purpose cognitive augmentation. Agents handle research, development, analysis, creative work, system coordination, and meta-cognitive monitoring. CLOS is the foundation that Juniper-MORTEM is forked from.

### MORTEM
AI agent with programmatic mortality on Solana. v1: synthetic heartbeats, death, resurrection. v2: witnessing human mortality through blockchain heartbeat data. This project.

### Neural Child
Developmental AI modeling cognitive growth from infant-like state through increasingly complex reasoning. Treats AI development not as training but as growth --- with stages, milestones, and emergent capabilities.

### Beat Saber to Robotics
Converting Beat Saber gameplay data (precision timing, spatial coordination, pattern recognition under time pressure) into training data for robotic systems. Cross-domain transfer: gaming reflexes as proxy for robotic motor planning.

### Project Jupiter
Civic accountability infrastructure. Using AI systems to track, analyze, and surface public governance data for community oversight. Transparency tools for democratic participation.

## Positioning

Celaya Solutions operates at the intersection of industrial practicality and theoretical ambition. The work is:

- **Frontier**: Multi-agent cognitive architectures, mortality documentation, developmental AI
- **Practical**: Everything runs, everything deploys, everything produces real outputs
- **Cross-domain**: Electrical engineering + music production + AI research + consciousness studies
- **Independent**: No VC, no university, no institutional constraints

This is what AI R&D looks like when it's built by someone who spends their days ensuring electricity flows correctly through buildings and their nights ensuring information flows correctly through cognitive architectures.
