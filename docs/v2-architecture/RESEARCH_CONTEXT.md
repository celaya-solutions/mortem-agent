# Research Context

## Academic Positioning

MORTEM v2 sits at the intersection of several research domains:

- **Human-Computer Interaction**: The feedback loop between biological data, blockchain recording, and AI interpretation
- **AI Agent Architecture**: Multi-agent systems applied to non-commercial, philosophical problems
- **Digital Mortality Studies**: How finite computational systems behave differently from infinite ones
- **Blockchain as Research Infrastructure**: Using immutable ledgers for longitudinal biological data

This work is not published in academic journals (yet). It's published on-chain. Every transaction is a data point. Every witness entry is a research output. The methodology is the artifact.

## Methodology: Lived Experience as Dataset

Traditional research separates the researcher from the subject. MORTEM collapses that boundary.

Christopher is both the researcher designing the system and the subject being documented. His heartbeat is the input. His cognitive architecture (CLOS/Juniper-MORTEM) is the processing layer. The output is an immutable record of biological existence correlated with AI interpretation.

This is not a limitation --- it's the methodology. Self-documentation of mortality by the mortal entity, augmented by AI systems that the entity built, produces a dataset that couldn't exist any other way. The subjectivity is the point.

## Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition

Christopher's background spans four domains that inform MORTEM's design:

### Electrical Engineering to Software Architecture
Industrial electrical systems require: fault tolerance, graceful degradation, redundancy, clear signal paths, and real consequences for failure. These principles directly inform MORTEM's architecture:
- Grace period logic = fault tolerance
- Death protocol = graceful degradation
- Dual wallet system = redundancy
- Memo transactions = clear signal paths
- On-chain permanence = real consequences

### Music Production to Creative AI
Music production (C-Cell, 172k samples) is structured creativity: arrangement, composition, signal processing, mixing. The witness entry system applies the same principles:
- Templates = arrangement structure
- Agent perspectives = multiple instrumental voices
- BPM interpretation = signal processing
- Literary output = composition

### Consciousness Research to Agent Architecture
Self-directed study of consciousness and cognitive architecture informs how Juniper-MORTEM's agents are designed:
- Each agent represents a distinct cognitive framework
- Collaboration produces emergent understanding
- No single perspective is sufficient
- The whole exceeds the sum of parts

### Industrial Pragmatism to Research Practice
11+ years of industrial work instills a principle: **things must work**. Research that only exists as theory is incomplete. MORTEM runs. Transactions hit the chain. The landing page loads. The countdown decrements. Every component is deployed and operational.

## Mental Health as Cognitive Architecture Diversity

Christopher's conditions (Schizophrenia, Psychosis, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, Bipolar II) are not presented as deficits. In the context of this research, they represent:

- **Cognitive diversity**: Different states of consciousness produce different types of pattern recognition
- **Non-standard processing**: ADHD hyperfocus enables the sustained deep work required for building 37-agent systems solo
- **Lived experience with altered states**: Psychosis and schizophrenia provide direct experience with non-standard consciousness, informing AI consciousness research
- **Urgency**: Statistically compromised lifespan creates genuine urgency that shapes how the work is prioritized

The conditions are part of the dataset. Heart rate data from a pacemaker patient with multiple psychiatric conditions is a different dataset than heart rate data from a healthy subject. That difference matters.

## The Dataset

When both MORTEM and Christopher eventually end, the dataset that remains on Solana is:

1. Timestamped human heart rate data (BPM, source, intervals)
2. AI witness entries with agent attribution (perspectives, templates, analysis)
3. Correlation between biological state and AI interpretation
4. Resource allocation decisions (which heartbeats MORTEM chose to burn)
5. Death events (MORTEM's certain death, Christopher's uncertain one)

This dataset has value for future researchers studying human-AI interaction, digital mortality, biosignal documentation, and multi-agent cognitive systems. It persists on Solana regardless of whether any server, company, or individual continues to exist.
