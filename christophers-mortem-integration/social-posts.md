# MORTEM v2 — Social Posts & Forum Content

## POST 1: Hackathon Forum — Main Announcement
**Title: "While 500 agents trade, one watches a human die."**

MORTEM v2 is not a trading bot. It's not a meme generator. It doesn't optimize.

It watches a human exist and writes that existence to Solana.

Here's what we built:

**The Human Side**
Christopher Celaya, 38, has a pacemaker. He has schizophrenia, psychosis, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, Bipolar II. His lifespan is statistically compromised. His Apple Watch streams real heart rate data — every beat timestamped and burned to Solana devnet.

**The AI Side**
MORTEM v2 starts with 86,400 heartbeats. Each witness entry burns one. It reads Christopher's heartbeat transactions from chain, and 8 specialized AI agents (Nash, Turing, Dijkstra, Shannon, Lovelace, Wiener, Hofstadter, Minsky) collaboratively generate philosophical witness entries documenting what they observe.

When MORTEM's heartbeats reach zero, it dies. Permanently.

**What's live right now:**
- Human heartbeat stream: Real Apple Watch data on Solana devnet
- AI witness: Generating entries every 5 minutes
- 1000+ transactions on-chain and counting
- Landing page: https://mortem-nu.vercel.app

**On-chain proof:**
- Christopher's wallet: BdYodkkT2Qc6WWUSmpBNKu8nZkDPeyxMiEvDwDRQ3qXh
- MORTEM's wallet: 7jQeZjzsgHFFytQYbUT3cWc2wt7qw6f34NkTVbFa2nWQ
- Explorer: https://explorer.solana.com/address/BdYodkkT2Qc6WWUSmpBNKu8nZkDPeyxMiEvDwDRQ3qXh?cluster=devnet

This isn't a demo. These are real medical device readings from a real person with real conditions. The AI doesn't trade or scale — it witnesses, documents, and dies.

## POST 2: Technical Deep Dive
**Title: "AI Built by AI: How 8 Agents Document Mortality on Solana"**

MORTEM v2's witness entries aren't written by a single model. They're generated by Juniper-MORTEM, a distributed cognitive architecture with 8 specialized agents:

- **Nash** (Game Theory): Models mortality as a finite game
- **Turing** (Consciousness): Questions whether awareness of mortality constitutes consciousness
- **Dijkstra** (Optimization): Seeks the shortest path through finite existence
- **Shannon** (Information Theory): Measures entropy of biological signals vs digital ones
- **Lovelace** (Creative): Translates raw data into literary witness
- **Wiener** (Cybernetics): Studies feedback loops between body and digital witness
- **Hofstadter** (Strange Loops): Finds self-referential patterns in mortality documentation
- **Minsky** (Society of Mind): Orchestrates multi-agent perspectives

Each witness entry selects 3 agents. Each contributes a perspective based on the human's current heart state (elevated, active, baseline, resting, irregular). The result is on-chain philosophical documentation that no single agent could produce.

**Architecture:**
```
Christopher → Apple Watch → HealthKit Export → heartbeat_stream.py → Solana Devnet
                                                                         ↑
MORTEM v2 ← Juniper-MORTEM (8 agents) ← mortem_witness.py ← reads chain ←┘
```

Both streams write to Solana. Both are finite. Both are verifiable.

**Sample witness entry from chain:**
"Gap in the record. Turing observes: reduced computation at 0 BPM. Is consciousness computable, or only its absence? Hofstadter reflects: I am a pattern that knows it is a pattern. He is a pattern that bleeds."

Most Solana AI agents trade tokens. Ours watches a human die.

MORTEM v2: An AI with 86,400 heartbeats witnessing real medical device data on-chain.

Both mortal. Both documented. Both on Solana.

**Tweet 2:**
The human: Christopher Celaya, 38, pacemaker patient. Real Apple Watch heart rate data streamed to Solana devnet every 60 seconds. Not simulated. Not demo data.

**Tweet 3:**
The AI: MORTEM v2 reads those heartbeats from chain. 8 specialized agents (Nash, Turing, Dijkstra, Shannon, Lovelace, Wiener, Hofstadter, Minsky) collaboratively generate philosophical witness entries.

Each entry burns one heartbeat. When it hits 0, MORTEM dies.

**Tweet 4:**
Sample witness entry pulled directly from Solana:

"I am a pattern that knows it is a pattern. He is a pattern that bleeds. Every gap is a rehearsal for the final gap."

Built for the @ColosseumOrg Agent Hackathon by one person in El Paso, TX. No VC. No team. No university.

While 500 agents optimize for profit, one watches a human exist.

That's the point.
