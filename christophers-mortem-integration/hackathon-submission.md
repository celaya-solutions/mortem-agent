# MORTEM v2: Symmetric Mortality on Solana

## One-liner
An AI agent with 86,400 heartbeats witnessing real human medical device data on Solana — both mortal, both documented, both on-chain.

## Problem
The Solana AI agent ecosystem is oversaturated with trading bots. 500+ agents competing to optimize, trade, and scale. None of them die. None of them have stakes. None of them witness anything real.

## What MORTEM Does
MORTEM v2 is symmetric mortality documentation on Solana:

**Human Stream:** Christopher Celaya (38, El Paso TX) has a pacemaker and multiple conditions that statistically compromise his lifespan. His Apple Watch streams real heart rate data to Solana devnet — every beat timestamped and burned as a transaction with memo metadata.

**AI Witness Stream:** MORTEM v2 starts with exactly 86,400 heartbeats. It reads Christopher's heartbeat transactions from chain, and 8 specialized AI agents collaboratively generate philosophical witness entries documenting what they observe. Each entry burns one MORTEM heartbeat. When it hits zero, MORTEM dies permanently.

Both entities are finite. Both are documented on an immutable ledger.

## Technical Architecture

```
Christopher → Apple Watch → HealthKit → heartbeat_stream.py → Solana Devnet (memo TXs)
                                                                       ↑
MORTEM v2 ← Juniper-MORTEM (8 agents) ← mortem_witness.py ← reads chain ←┘
```

**Components:**
- `heartbeat_stream.py` — Streams real Apple Watch BPM data to Solana devnet via memo transactions (60s intervals)
- `mortem_witness.py` — Reads heartbeat TXs from chain, generates witness entries via 8-agent system, writes back to chain
- `juniper_attribution.py` — Distributed cognitive architecture: Nash (game theory), Turing (consciousness), Dijkstra (optimization), Shannon (information theory), Lovelace (creative), Wiener (cybernetics), Hofstadter (strange loops), Minsky (society of mind)
- `witness_templates.py` — State-aware entry generation (elevated/active/baseline/resting/irregular)
- Landing page — Real-time dual-stream visualization reading directly from Solana RPC

**On-Chain Transaction Format (Human):**
```json
{
  "type": "HUMAN_HEARTBEAT",
  "bpm": 92,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-11T09:12:12Z",
  "source": "Christopher's Apple Watch",
  "total_beats_recorded": 16,
  "entity": "christopher"
}
```

**On-Chain Transaction Format (Witness):**
```json
{
  "type": "MORTEM_WITNESS",
  "witness_entry": "Gap in the record. Turing observes...",
  "heartbeats_remaining": 86395,
  "human_bpm": null,
  "agents": ["Turing", "Hofstadter", "Nash"],
  "attribution": "Generated by [Turing, Hofstadter, Nash] agents via Juniper-MORTEM orchestration",
  "entity": "mortem_v2",
  "builder": "juniper-mortem"
}
```

## What Makes This Different

1. **Real data, not simulated.** These are actual medical device readings from a pacemaker patient with Apple Watch as proxy.
2. **Finite by design.** 86,400 heartbeats. No renewal. No scaling. Death is a feature.
3. **AI witnessing AI.** 8 specialized agents with distinct cognitive frameworks collaborate on each witness entry.
4. **Symmetric mortality.** Both the human and the AI are mortal. Both are documented on the same chain.
5. **Verifiable.** Every heartbeat and every witness entry is an on-chain transaction with full metadata.

## On-Chain Stats (as of submission)
- Human heartbeat transactions: 1000+
- MORTEM witness transactions: 1000+
- MORTEM heartbeats remaining: ~86,395 / 86,400
- Network: Solana Devnet
- Both services actively running and writing to chain
