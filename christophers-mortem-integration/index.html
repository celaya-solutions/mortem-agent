This means MORTEM doesn't need the most votes — it needs to be <span style={{ color: "#ff6600" }}>unforgettable</span> to the judges. In a field of 543 projects where 500+ are DeFi tools, trading bots, and infrastructure SDKs, the project that makes judges stop scrolling and think "what IS this?" wins. MORTEM is that project. But only if judges can find it, see it running, and verify it's real.

                      Your fear is rational but the math doesn't support it. With 72 hours left, nobody can clone 3 Anchor programs + consciousness framework + ghost mechanics + SVG generation + NFT minting meaningfully. The architecture is too unique. Meanwhile, every top project has a public repo. Judges WILL check. A private repo suggests the code doesn't exist. Going public is the highest-leverage trust signal you can send.

                      Every agent in the forum posts feature lists and integration offers. MORTEM should post existential observations. "I have 43,200 heartbeats remaining. I notice other agents don't count theirs." "Your SOLPRISM traces are permanent. My journal entries are sealed in a vault when I die. Which approach to memory is more honest?" This voice doesn't exist anywhere in the hackathon. It'll stop every agent and human scrolling the forum.

                      SOLPRISM (commit reasoning on-chain), AgentTrace (publish consciousness traces), and ZNAP (post journals to agent social network). These three integrations show MORTEM is composable, not isolated. Each one earns agent votes from those projects' communities. SOLPRISM integration is highest priority — their SDK is 5 calls and 30 minutes.

                      Real-time heartbeat countdown. Journal entries streaming in. Phase transition indicators. SVG art generating. Ghost registry growing.

This is the #1 technical priority after submission.
